# Graph Intelligence Platform

A full-stack analytics solution that integrates relational databases (RDBMS), Hadoop (HDFS), and TigerGraph to deliver real-time insights from complex, interconnected data using GSQL, REST APIs, and graph visualization.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Model customer-product-behavior relationships using TigerGraph.
- Ingest data from PostgreSQL and HDFS.
- Write and run advanced GSQL queries (e.g., centrality, similarity, community detection).
- Expose TigerGraph insights via a Python REST API.
- Visualize relationships using React.js and PyVis.
- Automate data pipelines with Unix Shell and Autosys-style scheduling.
